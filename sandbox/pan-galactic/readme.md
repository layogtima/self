# PAN-GALACTIC GARGLE TRADING

_Don't Panic! A Hitchhiker's Guide to Galactic Commerce_

## Game Concept

You are a hapless human who has been unwittingly thrust into the role of an interstellar trader after the destruction of Earth to make way for a hyperspace bypass. Armed with nothing but your towel and a copy of "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy," you must navigate the absurdities of cosmic capitalism to earn enough money to find the legendary planet of Magrathea.

## Design Constraints

- Single font: Space Mono (fallback: monospace)
- Single color palette: Various shades of teal (#00FFFF to #003333)
- Iconography: Font Awesome icons only
- File structure: index.html, style.css, script.js only

## Core Game Systems

### Locations

Players travel between iconic locations from the Hitchhiker's universe:

- **Earth** (starting location, accessible only at game start)
- **Milliways** (The Restaurant at the End of the Universe)
- **Vogon Constructor Fleet**
- **Betelgeuse Trading Platform**
- **Ursa Minor Beta** (home of the Hitchhiker's Guide HQ)
- **Deep Thought Computer World**
- **Traal** (home of the Ravenous Bugblatter Beast)
- **Damogran** (home of the Heart of Gold)
- **Magrathea** (unlocked after meeting specific game conditions)

### Resources/Commodities

- **Pan Galactic Gargle Blaster** (highly valuable, fluctuating price)
- **Babel Fish** (rare but useful for trading with alien species)
- **Genuine People Personalities** (for robots and doors)
- **Infinite Improbability Drive Parts**
- **Nutrimatic Drinks** (almost, but not quite, entirely unlike tea)
- **Vogon Poetry Books** (dangerous to carry but valuable to the right buyer)
- **Towels** (essential item, provides trading bonuses)
- **Digital Copies of the Guide** (provides market information)
- **Jynnan Tonnyx** (less potent version of the Pan Galactic Gargle Blaster)
- **Algolian Zylatburger** (perishable food item)

### Game Mechanics

#### Trading System

- Each location has different buy/sell prices for commodities
- Prices fluctuate based on:
  - Random events ("Somebody Else's Problem field activated")
  - Location-specific multipliers
  - Improbability factor (random but predictable within ranges)
  - Player reputation with different species

#### Travel System

- Travel between locations costs money or resources
- Certain routes require special items (e.g., Electronic Thumb for hitchhiking)
- Improbability Drive: Chance to randomly teleport to any location (including normally inaccessible ones)
- Time passes as you travel (affects perishable items and market conditions)

#### Random Events

- **Vogon Poetry Reading**: Lose money or items unless you have specific protection
- **Infinite Improbability Event**: Drastically changes market prices across all locations
- **Heart of Gold Visit**: Opportunity to acquire rare items
- **Galactic Tax Audit**: Lose a percentage of your money
- **Ravenous Bugblatter Beast Attack**: Lose items unless you have a towel
- **Guide Update**: Receive new information about optimal trading routes
- **Restaurant at the End of the Universe Reservation**: Special trading opportunity with customers from the future

#### Player Stats

- **Money**: Measured in Altairian Dollars
- **Reputation** with various species (affects trading prices):
  - Humans (rare and sometimes valuable as Earth was destroyed)
  - Vogons (bureaucratic and difficult)
  - Betelgeusians (good traders)
  - Dentrassi (love to party, good source of Pan Galactic Gargle Blasters)
  - Magratheans (master builders, difficult to access)

#### Game Progression

- **Early Game**: Basic trading between accessible planets, earning enough for better ships
- **Mid Game**: Unlock special trading routes, build reputation with species
- **Late Game**: Discover the coordinates to Magrathea, gather enough wealth to commission a new Earth

#### Win Condition

Accumulate 1 million Altairian Dollars and locate Magrathea to commission a new Earth, or discover the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything (special hidden questline).

## Technical Implementation

### Data Structures

#### Locations

```javascript
{
  id: "betelgeuse",
  name: "Betelgeuse Trading Platform",
  description: "A bustling commercial hub where anything can be bought or soldâ€”emphasis on anything.",
  guideEntry: "The Betelgeuse Trading Platform was built from the recycled remains of...",
  travelCosts: {
    "milliways": 500,
    "vogon_fleet": 300,
    // etc.
  },
  marketModifiers: {
    "pan_galactic_gargle_blaster": 0.8, // 20% cheaper than average
    "babel_fish": 1.3, // 30% more expensive than average
    // etc.
  },
  availableItems: ["pan_galactic_gargle_blaster", "babel_fish", "towels"],
  events: ["tax_audit", "guide_update"],
  requiredItems: null // No special items needed to access
}
```

#### Items

```javascript
{
  id: "pan_galactic_gargle_blaster",
  name: "Pan Galactic Gargle Blaster",
  description: "Like having your brains smashed out by a slice of lemon wrapped around a large gold brick.",
  guideEntry: "The Pan Galactic Gargle Blaster is the alcoholic equivalent of a mugging...",
  baseValue: 150,
  volatility: 0.5, // High price fluctuation
  weight: 1,
  perishable: true,
  perishTime: 10, // Turns before it goes bad
  specialEffects: {
    "dentrassi_reputation": 0.1 // Improves Dentrassi reputation when traded
  }
}
```

#### Player

```javascript
{
  credits: 1000,
  location: "earth",
  inventory: [
    {itemId: "towel", quantity: 1},
    {itemId: "guide", quantity: 1}
  ],
  reputation: {
    "humans": 1.0,
    "vogons": 0.2,
    "betelgeusians": 0.5,
    "dentrassi": 0.5,
    "magratheans": 0.0
  },
  visitedLocations: ["earth"],
  turnCount: 0,
  specialItemsDiscovered: [],
  questProgress: {
    "ultimate_question": 0,
    "heart_of_gold": 0
  }
}
```

### Core Game Loop

1. Player views current location information
2. Interacts with market (buy/sell)
3. Chooses next destination
4. Random event may occur
5. Travel occurs, time passes
6. Market prices update
7. Repeat from step 1

### Random Price Generation

Prices for each item in each location follow this formula:

```javascript
function calculatePrice(item, location, turn) {
  const basePrice = item.baseValue;
  const locationModifier = location.marketModifiers[item.id] || 1.0;
  const volatility = item.volatility;

  // Pseudorandom but deterministic based on turn number and location
  const randomFactor = seededRandom(turn + location.id.charCodeAt(0));
  const fluctuation = 1 + (randomFactor * volatility * 2 - volatility);

  return Math.round(basePrice * locationModifier * fluctuation);
}
```
