# README.MD FOR MY OWN DAMN SELF

## WHO THE F$@% IS AMIT?

I've been online since I was 9. My brain's a delightful buffet of design, engineering, science, and absurdity. I also spin a _mean_ Dapostar!

## WHAT'S THIS WEBSITE THING?

This is my digital playground. It's where I showcase my shenanigans.

It's built using a monochrome platette, geometric patterns, and subtle animations that should make you go mmmMMMm.

## THE COOL SHIT IT DOES

- **Monochrome** - Black and white because colors are distractions
- **Responsive AF** - Looks sick on your smart fridge or your fancy smartphone
- **Dark/Light Mode** - For both vampires and humans
- **SVG Animations** - Subtle movement without triggering seizures
- **Accessibility** - Because I'm not a monster
- **Microinteractions** - Little delights for the attentive

## TECH STACK

- \*_HTML5_ - Because websites need bones
- **Tailwind CSS** - For when atomic CSS classes
- **Vanilla JS** - No framework bloat here
- **SVG** - Vector graphics that scale like your ego

## MY DESIGN PHILOSOPHY (MONO)

I stripped away the distractions to focus on what matters: typography, layout, and form. What works in black and white works anywhere. It's like a minimalist's fever dream up in here.

## FEATURED SECTIONS

- **MONO** - My exploration of design within constraints
- **EXPLORATIONS** - Various digital rabbit holes I'm experimenting with
- **COLLECTIVES** - The creative gangs I roll with:
  - **[CODEUNCODE.COM](https://codeuncode.com/)** - UI/UX design studio for the discerning
  - **[SM0L.DEV](https://sm0l.dev/)** - Web technology nerds who occasionally snort JavaScript
  - **[ABSURD.INDUSTRIES](https://absurd.industries/)** - Hardware weirdos making open-source gadgets
  - **[SUPERVILLAINS.WTF](https://supervillains.wtf/)** - Flow arts community for the playful misfits

## SKILLS I'LL TRADE FOR MONEY OR BAKED GOODS

- **WEB DESIGN + DEV** - Making the internet less ugly
- **HARDWARE** - Building physical things that do stuff
- **DAPO HYPEMAN** - Spinning a Dapostar and being loud about it
- **SHARING & COMMUNITY** - Teaching humans to human better

## TO-DO (THAT I'LL PROBABLY PROCRASTINATE ON)

- [ ] Create an indepdent page for work
- [ ] Make more interactive toys in the explorations section
- [ ] Optimize images because performance matters (sometimes)
